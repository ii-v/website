Programming (I'm currently learning C)
Kerbal Space Program (and making tools for it)
Reading, at the moment I read a lot of P.G. Wodehouse
Snails! This summer I'm planning on doing some snail farming (heliculture)
Writing. Anything really; fiction, non-fiction, poems. I don't claim I'm good at it, but I enjoy it. Keep in mind, though, that English isn't my first language
